      - Concrete jacketing with high-performance materials
      - Carbon fiber reinforcement for column strengthening
      - Strategic shear wall additions at optimal locations
      - Diaphragm enhancements to improve lateral force distribution

      Advanced computational modeling allows engineers to identify the most efficient reinforcement strategies, maximizing performance improvements while minimizing costs and disruption.

      ## Compliance Considerations

      Seismic retrofit projects for government buildings must navigate complex regulatory frameworks. Current best practices include:

      - Early engagement with building officials to establish performance objectives
      - Adoption of performance-based design approaches where appropriate
      - Phased implementation strategies that prioritize critical vulnerabilities
      - Documentation systems that facilitate ongoing compliance as codes evolve

      Successful projects balance technical requirements with operational constraints, ensuring government facilities remain functional throughout the retrofit process.
